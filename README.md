# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

This project showcases an **interactive and visually rich Weather Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**, powered by **real-time data from WeatherAPI.com**.

The dashboard provides **current weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, air quality metrics, and environmental insights** in a clean, modern dark-themed UI, making weather analysis simple and intuitive.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard fetches live data through the **WeatherAPI REST API** and transforms it into meaningful visuals using Power BI.

It is designed to:
- Monitor **current weather conditions**
- Analyze **weekly temperature trends**
- Track **air quality indicators**
- Display **sunrise & sunset timings**
- Show **rain probability by day**
